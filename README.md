# GroupRandomizerApp(UPDATE3)
App that randomizes names and put them into a group of whichever group size

To run the app, download this whole folder to your computer and open the folder with vs Code

*(in update 3 just download this whole folder and click on userInterface.exe to run the app)*

To tweak the group size, go to the nameAllocator function, the if counter <= x (here is where group sizes are modified)

Paste files to the filesToBeRead Folder, just as they appear in the demo.txt

Paste names as they are seen in the demo file. in that format, just delete the names and paste your own new ones there or just add a new .txt file in the filesToBeRead with the same format as the one in the demo.txt

when entering a new name, go to a new line

Groups will be displayed on the console
