# GroupRandomizerApp
App that randomizes names and put them into a group of whichever group size

To run the app, download this whole folder to your computer

To tweak the group size, go to the nameAllocator function, the if counter <= x (here is where group sizes are modified)

Paste names to the demo text document and click on run
Paste names as they are seen in the demo file, when entering a new name, go to a new line

Groups will be displayed on the console
