# GroupRandomizerApp(UPDATE1)
App that randomizes names and put them into a group of whichever group size

To run the app, download this whole folder to your computer and open the folder with vs Code

To tweak the group size, go to the nameAllocator function, the if counter <= x (here is where group sizes are modified)

Paste names to the demo text document and click on run.

Paste names as they are seen in the demo file. in that format, just delete the names and paste your own new ones there
when entering a new name, go to a new line

Groups will be displayed on the console

Version 0.5 has no ui, i am currently working on one

Version 1(update) -> new ui was added, albeit very very simple
