Group system documentation

How we can make a group sorting system to solve the issues of group assignment:


version 0.5
***********

to run the app, press play above, input names into the demo.txt file, or change the current directory
takes txt document and puts it into an array
when putting in names to the file, put them the way they have been put in the demo file
Feel free shuffling


enjoy :) , it can be modified for all manner of group sizes too
feel free to also add some features on to it :)


version 1
**********

Ui updated, finally done, version 1 ui, takes in the file path and the number of users per group
to actually help in the randomizer process, ui has 2 inputs and on click of generation, it opens a
new window

version 1.5
************

performed some bug fixes  
-> improved group placing accuracy
